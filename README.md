# FdF @ 42

A simple 3D height-map renderer. You can rotate models, color is defined by
relative height in the map. More features planned!

## Features
* Simple file format definition (array of space-separated integers)
* 3D rotations with the mouse
* Camera controls (zoom, translate)
* Pretty color gradients!
* Double-buffered
* Line clipping

### Planned features
* Other projections (right now it's just orthographic)
* Different view modes: point map, wireframe, and filled
* More color modes: gradient, file-defined and z-buffer
* Depth shader
* Multithreaded calculations (OpenCL even?)
* Anti-aliased rendering
* Level-of-detail (less points when you zoom out on huge maps)

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run it with `./fdf [map]`. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the `test_maps`
directory. One of the popular maps is `test_maps/42.fdf`.

Controls are: drag with left click to rotate, drag with right to zoom, drag with
both to move around.

## FDF Usage

```
Usage:		FDF		fdf_file

Controls:

	[Esc]        -> Exit the program.
	[R]          -> Reset the map.
	[M]          -> Colorize this shit!.
	[B][N]       -> Zoom in and zoom out.
	[J][K]       -> Spiky time!
	[Space]      -> Change the camera(isometric <-> plain).
	[W][A][S][D] -> Move the map.
```
